## **Detailed Insights from Dashboard**

### 1. **Overall Insights**
- **Average Days to Harvest**: **102 days**.  
   *Insight*: On average, most crops take approximately 3.5 months to mature. Planning harvest cycles is crucial for labor allocation and logistics.  

- **Average Yield per Hectare**: **4.614 tons/hectare**.  
   *Insight*: This metric serves as a baseline to assess yield performance across regions, soil types, and weather conditions.

- **Average Rainfall**: **520.886 mm**.  
   *Insight*: Indicates that most regions received moderate rainfall suitable for crop growth.

- **Median Temperature**: **27.724째C**.  
   *Insight*: Temperature is within the optimal range for many crops, though regional variations exist.

---

### 2. **Region-Specific Insights**
- **Rainfall by Region**:  
   - **North** received the **highest median rainfall** (~700 mm).  
   - Other regions (West, South, East) received approximately **400-500 mm**.  
   *Managerial Insight*:  
   Regions receiving higher rainfall can focus on water-dependent crops (e.g., rice). Excessive rainfall management strategies like drainage systems are essential.  

- **Temperature Distribution**:  
   - **East** had the **highest median temperature** (~35째C).  
   - **South** had the lowest (~27째C).  
   *Managerial Insight*:  
   High temperatures in the East may require heat-resistant crops or irrigation scheduling to avoid water stress.

- **Days to Harvest by Region**:  
   - **East** recorded the highest average (~120 days).  
   - Other regions are relatively consistent (~100-110 days).  
   *Insight*: Longer harvest times in the East may affect resource allocation and productivity planning.

### 3. **Impact of Fertilizer Usage on Yield**
- Yield is significantly higher where **fertilizers were used**:  
   - **TRUE**: ~8 tons/hectare.  
   - **FALSE**: ~4 tons/hectare.  
   *Managerial Insight*:  
   Fertilizer application nearly **doubles the yield**, highlighting its critical role in enhancing productivity. Farmers and stakeholders should prioritize proper fertilizer application techniques.

### 6. **Yield Trends by Weather Conditions**
- **Cloudy and Rainy weather** led to higher yields compared to **Sunny weather**.  
   *Insight*: Rainfall and moderate sunlight promote better yields, but excessive sunlight without irrigation may reduce productivity.  

---

### 7. **Temperature Trends Over Regions**
- Temperature fluctuated across regions, with East experiencing the **highest peaks**.  
   *Managerial Insight*: Temperature variability requires adaptive practices such as crop rotation or selection of heat-tolerant crops.
